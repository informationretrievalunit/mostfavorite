Scrapped media ratings for personal use only... Check it out at mostfavorite.herokuapp.com

How does it work?
Node.js presents static files created with Vue.js to the client. On the other hand, it keeps scraping the source for possible updates in the relevant data. The final information is saved and retrieved from remote mongo database on a free account.

How may you use it personally?
You can click on the "menu" button and choose to include, exclude or filter out several content. Also you can switch media type from films to games in the same menu.

Please note that this project is made for personal use and demonstration of skills.

Thank you for stopping by.
